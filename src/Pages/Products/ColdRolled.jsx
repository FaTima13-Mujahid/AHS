<p style={{lineHeight:"2.4"}}>Cold rolled coils and sheets, also referred to as cold reduced coils, CRC (Cold Rolled Coils), or flat steel products, are finished steel products processed to achieve superior surface quality and precise dimensions. These products are produced by passing a hot rolled sheet or strip, previously pickled to remove scale, through cold rolls below the metal's recrystallization temperature. The cold rolling process enhances the material's surface finish, uniformity, and strength, making it suitable for high-end applications.</p>
<p style={{lineHeight:"2.4"}}>Flat steel coil products are categorized based on their dimensions. Products with widths less than 600mm for hot rolled and less than 500mm for cold rolled products are commonly called narrow strips, while wider flat products are referred to as wide strips. Cold rolled coils and sheets are highly sought after in industries like automotive, construction, appliances, and manufacturing due to their superior qualities, including tighter tolerances, enhanced strength, and a smooth, polished finish.</p>
<p style={{lineHeight:"2.4"}}>Cold rolling results in thinner, more refined, and stronger materials compared to hot rolling alone. Additionally, cold rolled products can be further treated or coated for improved durability, corrosion resistance, and aesthetic appeal. These characteristics make them ideal for precision applications where performance and appearance are critical, such as in the production of car body panels, household appliances, furniture, and precision tools.</p>
